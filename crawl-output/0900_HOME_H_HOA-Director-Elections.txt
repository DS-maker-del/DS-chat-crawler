It includes acclamation for both. It can be used non-director elections as well.&nbsp;The following election timelines do NOT include acclamation. Annual Meetings Frequency of Meetings . Most membership meetings are held annually. However, the frequency of their meetings can be changed by&nbsp; amending the bylaws . Per the Corporations Code, associations must hold membership meetings as often as the bylaws specify, but no less often than&nbsp;director elections are required. ( Corp. Code &sect; 7510(b) ) The Davis Stirling Act states that director elections are held at the expiration of terms and at least once every four years. ( Civ. Code&nbsp;&sect; 5100(a)(2) ) The only mandatory criteria are having a membership meeting as often as the association has elections and&nbsp;whatever the bylaws require. For example, if the bylaws require director elections every two years (everyone serving concurrent two-year terms), the association can hold its membership meetings biennially. They could also be done every three years if all directors served concurrent three-year terms and the bylaws allowed it. Setting the Date . Sometimes,&nbsp;bylaws will set a date for when annual meetings must be held. Some will state that members must meet annually from the first meeting set by the declarant. The corporation&#39;s code provides some flexibility since circumstances can cause meetings to be delayed. Meetings can be held&nbsp;within&nbsp; 60 days &nbsp;after the date designated in the governing documents or within&nbsp; 15 months &nbsp;of the association&#39;s last regular meeting (if no date is specified),&nbsp;( Corp. Code &sect; 7510 ) Failure to Meet . If the board fails or refuses to timely hold an annual membership meeting, the superior court may summarily order the meeting to be held or the ballot to be conducted upon the application of a member to the Attorney General&nbsp;after notice to the corporation allowing it to be heard.&nbsp;( Corp. Code &sect; 7510 ;&nbsp; Samii v La Villa Grande ) Board Continues . Until a new election is held, directors remain on the board until successors have been elected and qualified. ( Corp. Code &sect; 7220(b) ) Elections Requiring Secret Ballots&nbsp; As required by&nbsp; Civil Code &sect; 5100(a) , the following matters must be voted by secret ballot, regardless of any provision to the contrary in an association&#39;s governing documents: special assessments over 5% (see&nbsp; exception for emergency assessments ) or regular assessments over 20% ( Civ. Code &sect; 5605 ), election and removal of directors, amendments to the governing documents (see&nbsp; exception for board-approved amendments )&nbsp;and grant of exclusive use of common area property (see&nbsp; exception to membership approval ). Member surveys &nbsp;do not require a secret ballot. WRITTEN BALLOTS ELECTRONIC VOTING (Opt Out Method) Beginning July 1, 2006, associations must adopt election rules that use secret balloting for the election and removal of directors. ( Civ.&nbsp;Code &sect; 5100(a) ) Beginning January 1, 2025, associations can conduct director elections by electronic secret ballots.&nbsp;To use electronic balloting, associations must first amend their election rules.&nbsp; If an association wants to use electronic balloting, it must first amend its election rules&nbsp;( Civ. Code&nbsp;&sect; 5105(i) ) and&nbsp;include information in its annual statement on the procedures to either opt out of or opt into voting by electronic secret ballot. ( Civ. Code&nbsp;&sect; 5105(i)(1)(D) ) As noted above,&nbsp;boards should amend their election rules at least six months before their next annual meeting. Opt Out Method . The following timeline uses the opt out method. It means the association has decided to use electronic balloting. A&nbsp;person who does not want to vote electronically&nbsp;but, instead, wants a paper ballot, must notify the association he/she is opting out of electronic voting. Set Meeting Date and Hire Inspector Four months before voting deadline, select a date for the annual meeting and hire&nbsp;an inspector of elections. Locking in an inspector early ensures they will be available to oversee your election.&nbsp; Five months before the voting deadline, select a date for the annual meeting and hire an inspector of elections.

Since annual meetings are once a year, the board can approve the minutes. &quot;Minutes of one annual meeting should not be held for action until the next one a year later.&quot; (RONR (12th ed.) 9:22)&nbsp;They can be approved by the board of directors. (RONR (12th ed.) 48:12)&nbsp;The best way to accomplish this is to have the board of directors approve the minutes of the annual membership meeting at the first regular board meeting that follows the annual membership meeting (or if that first board meeting is the same day as the annual membership meeting, then the regular board meeting after that first board meeting). This is consistent with the Corporations Code, allowing the minutes to be approved promptly and without needing a quorum at the following year&#39;s membership meeting. An added benefit is that what occurred at the meeting will be fresh in the directors&#39; minds, which ensures more accurate minutes.
