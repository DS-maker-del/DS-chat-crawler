ADAMS In the 1980s, a young Marine with expertise in radar, infrared, and reconnaissance systems in F-4 Phantom fighter jets and a degree in psychology began managing large-scale common interest developments while earning an MBA from UCLA. He had been managing large gated communities and luxury highrises and planned to move into large-scale resort management. Those plans took an unexpected turn when two law firms independently approached Adrian and asked him to enter law and specialize in common interest developments. A law degree soon followed as did a line of clients the day he was sworn into the practice of law. Adrian quickly built a large boutique law firm providing quality legal services to common interest developments throughout California. Davis-Stirling.com . Adrian used his background in technology to create Davis-Stirling.com which he launched in in January 2004. Adrian&nbsp;designed the website, did all the programming, wrote all the articles, and set up all the internal linking to make it easy for users to maneuver through the website. His website&nbsp; won awards and quickly became the leading resource in the industry with thousands of pages of content and millions of page views per year. That same year, he began publishing the ADAMS | STIRLING Newsletter. Adrian&rsquo;s unique blend of humor and common-sense approach to the law made his newsletter the most popular and most-read CID newsletter in California. HON. LARRY STIRLING A born leader, Larry Stirling served in the Army where he quickly became an officer commanding a 550-man unit in Korea and was awarded the Combat Badge for infantry operations along the DMZ. He was then assigned to the 12th Special Forces (Green Berets), went to airborne school, and became an A Team commander. From there, Mr. Stirling was assigned to the Pentagon before retiring from the Army. Following active duty, Larry graduated from law school and was elected to the San Diego City Council. He then served four terms in the Assembly and one in the Senate. In the legislature, Larry authored over 200 pieces of legislation, including the&nbsp;landmark legislation known as the Davis-Stirling Act, which governs&nbsp;all common interest developments in California. Larry was then elected to the State Senate. While in the Senate, he was appointed to the Bench by Governor Deukmejian, where he served for fourteen years. It was upon his retirement as a judge that Larry joined forces with Adrian Adams to form ADAMS | STIRLING PLC. FIRM&#39;S LEADERSHIP As the firm grew and opened offices throughout the state, it attracted talented attorneys who rose to become partners in the firm. As part of their practice, the firm&rsquo;s partners assumed leadership positions both in California and on the national level. Adrian Adams became President of the Foundation for Community Association&nbsp;Research&nbsp;and Partner Laurie Poole became President of the College of Community Association Lawyers.&nbsp; In addition to speaking and writing, members of the firm are active in training boards of directors and managers on how to reduce legal exposure for themselves and their associations. In addition, the firm serves as consumer advocates in the legislative process in Sacramento supporting bills that improve associations and opposing bills that harm them. &nbsp; Main Index Main Index Statutes Case Law Awards Legal Terms Of Use Privacy Statement Disclaimer Contact Us (800) 464-2817 &nbsp; Connect Free Newsletter Linkedin Share Email Google Favorites More Copyright 2004-2025.
