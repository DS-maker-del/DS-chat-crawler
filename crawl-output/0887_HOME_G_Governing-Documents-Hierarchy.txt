Sometimes, there are conflicts between documents. As provided for in&nbsp; Civil Code &sect; 4205 &nbsp;(effective January 1, 2014), such conflicts are resolved as follows: &nbsp;Law (unless the particular statute&nbsp;defers to governing documents) &nbsp;CC&amp;Rs &nbsp;Articles of Incorporation &nbsp;Bylaws &nbsp;Operating Rules. The exception to Rules being in last place is that&nbsp;Election Rules, a form of Operating Rules, ( Civ. Code &sect; 5105(a) ) adopted pursuant to Senate Bill 323 (effective January 1, 2020) may contain provisions that supersede Bylaws and CC&amp;Rs. Resolving Internal Conflicts Conflicts between provisions in the same document can often be resolved by applying general&nbsp; rules of interpretation .
