Managers are administrators, not licensed contractors, architects, and engineers. Coordinating&nbsp;small&nbsp;projects may be an extra under their management agreement but only if the manager is experienced enough to handle the project and for an hourly fee for the extra time required of them. It is imprudent of boards to burden managers with construction management which could result in costly problems once the project is done. Bid specifications need to be prepared by others who have appropriate expertise.&nbsp;For most construction projects, associations should use the services of a construction manager. Following is a general outline of services provided by a construction manager: Scope of Work . Prepare a bid package that integrates the repairs desired by the board with the proper specifications for achieving those repairs and a timeline for completing the project. This will allow an &quot;apples to apples&quot; comparison of bids. Bidding Oversight . Solicit bids from qualified contractors (licensed, insured and experienced), walk the project with the contractors, receive and evaluate bids, and make recommendations to the board of directors. Project Oversight . The construction manager oversees the project on the association&#39;s behalf and handles the following functions: Preliminaries &bull; Establish a proper scope of work. &bull; Prepare bid documents to obtain &ldquo;apples to apples&rdquo; bids. &bull; Bid the work to prequalified, properly insured contractors. &bull; Review bids and make recommendation on the selection of the contractor. &bull; Obtain all necessary insurance documents. &bull; Make sure permits are pulled. &bull; Review safety policies with contractors. &bull; Establish staging areas and sanitary facilities. &bull; Ensure notices to residents. Project Inspections &bull; Check for incomplete, substandard or incorrect work. &bull; Photo document the work. &bull; Inspect invoices and time sheets. &bull; Verify that materials match contract specifications. &bull; Review change orders. &bull; Approve monthly invoices and lien releases. &bull; Report to the board on the progress of the work. Project Completion &bull; Participate in final job walk-through. &bull; Prepare and oversee punch list work. &bull; Ensure warranty documents are delivered. &bull; Have contractor file a notice of completion with the county. &bull; Recommend release of final monies upon satisfactory completion.
