It created a lot of interest and requests for more information. I then published a summary of elite military units and their mottoes. -Adrian Adams SEALs &nbsp;(Navy). Established in 1962, SEALs operate on SEa, Air, and Land conducting unconventional warfare. They carry out clandestine, high-impact missions and special reconnaissance. Their motto, &quot;The only easy day was yesterday.&quot; Force Recon (Marines). Created in 1775, the entire U.S. Marine Corps considers itself an elite force. Within the Corps is a unit similar to the Navy SEALS called Force Recon. They operate as ghost units going deep behind enemy lines to gather intelligence and perform special operations against high-value targets. Their motto, &quot;Swift, Silent, Deadly.&quot; Rangers (Army). Formed in 1942, Army Rangers are rapid light infantry who perform airborne operations, raids, ambushes, and airfield seizures. Their primary mission is to engage in close combat and direct-fire battles. Their motto, &quot;Rangers lead the way! Green Berets (Army). Formed in 1952, Army Special Forces known as Green Berets conduct guerrilla warfare, sabotage, and subversion. Their training includes languages, culture, diplomacy, psychological warfare, and disinformation. Their motto, &quot;To Free the Oppressed.&quot; Delta Force (Army). Formed in 1977, this elite and secretive force specializes in hostage rescue and counter-terrorism as well as direct action against high-value targets. They recruit from Rangers and Green Berets. Their motto, &quot;Surprise, Speed, Success.&quot; Board Members (HOAs). Emerging in the 1960s, these elite volunteers oversee common interest developments under the harshest conditions imaginable. They have two mottoes: &quot;Survive The Next Meeting&quot; and &quot;Never Again!&quot;&nbsp; FEEDBACK Elite Warriors #1 .&nbsp; Could you possibly be any smarter or any funnier? Being an &quot;elite warrior&quot; myself, I agree wholeheartedly. Thank you for the LOL. -B. Elite Warriors #2 . Your comment adding board members to your list of the special forces groups was hysterical, but you forgot one group. Managers. I love your newsletter, always informative and regularly entertaining. -Lisa H. Elite Warriors #3 . &nbsp; I&#39;m waiting for you to share how Adams Stirling&#39;s senior partner, the Hon. Lawrence W. Stirling&#39;s public service actually stretches wa-a-ay back before his legislative efforts as author of the Davis-Stirling Act, to his service as an Army officer. Good job! I thank you for that. -Patsy F. Elite Warriors #4 . Your article on the mottoes of different service groups was truly informative. It also explains what happened to UDTs (Underwater Demolition Teams), they became SEALS. I laughed out loud when I came to the last branch of service. The only difference between us board members and the military is they get paid, can retire with a pension, and at some point people stop shooting at them. -Nancy H.
