A managing agent is one who represents another, called the principal, in dealings with third persons. ( Civ. Code &sect; 2295 ) A manager is &quot;a person or entity who, for compensation or in expectation of compensation, exercises control over the assets of a common interest development.&quot; ( Civ. Code &sect; 4158(a) ; Berryman v. Merit Management ) Boards may delegate the day-to-day operations of their associations. Some duties, however, cannot be delegated and must remain with the board.&nbsp; Common Interest Development Manager . A CID manager does not include a common interest development management firm. ( Bus &amp; Prof. &sect; 11503 ) It means an individual who, for compensation or in expectation of compensation, provides or contracts to provide management or financial services or represents himself or herself to act in the capacity of providing management or financial services to a community association. It includes: A person in a partnership, a corporation, or any other business entity who advises, supervises, and directs the activity of an association. A person operating under a fictitious business name who provides the services of a manager. ( Bus. &amp; Prof. &sect; 11501 ) Management Services . While there are different types of management structures, management services means an act performed or offered in an advisory capacity that includes the following: Administering or supervising the financial or common area assets of a community association at the direction of the board. ( Civ. Code &sect; 5380 ) Implementing resolutions and directives of the board. Implementing provisions of governing documents, which govern the operation of the association.

Communications With HOA Attorney . See &quot; Attorney-Client Privelege .&quot; Forms of HOA Management The primary duty of a board of directors is to manage their association. While some responsibilities are nondelegable , boards can delegate duties to a managing agent. Following are the forms of management commonly found in homeowner associations: Self-Management . Small associations frequently use self-management, i.e., the board directly manages the association without the assistance of professional management. Management Company . Small and medium-sized associations often employ a management company to handle day-to-day operations. It includes receiving assessments, paying bills, preparing monthly financial reports ( Civ. Code &sect; 5500 ), preparing and mailing the annual budget report and policy statement ( Civ. Code &sect; 5300 and &sect; 5310 ), performing property inspections, soliciting bids for projects, handling correspondence, preparing board meeting packets, etc.&nbsp; Onsite Management . Large and high-end mid-sized associations often employ a full-time onsite manager to handle operations. Sending monthly invoices,&nbsp;mailing&nbsp;bills, and receiving assessments is done in-house or contracted with a management company. The onsite manager can be a direct employee of the association or an employee of a management company. The arrangement provides the full service described above but with a higher level of service since management and staff are on site. Community Managers Individual managers can be classified into the following two categories: Portfolio Managers . A portfolio manager is an individual who works for a management company and manages multiple associations. The manager works from the management company&#39;s office, handling board and homeowner requests by telephone and email. Onsite Managers . An onsite manager handles a single association account, working from an office at the association. The manager can either be employed directly by the association or be on the payroll of a management company. Management Companies Management companies generally fall into four categories based on size. All will offer financial management services or full management. Small . A small company has a handful of employees who manage a small number of associations within a small region. Medium . A medium company has a larger staff and a region that covers multiple counties. Large . A large company may offer services throughout the state, including in-house maintenance services. Mega . Mega companies cover multiple states and may offer management services in adjacent countries. They might also provide in-house insurance, banking, and maintenance services.
