Although the house cat and its closest wild relative both possess 38 chromosomes, they are genetically different and cannot interbreed. If raised with little or no human contact, house cats can become feral. Adult feral cats that never socialized with humans can rarely be socialized.&nbsp;As for leashes, associations can adopt their own leash requirements apart from any that cities and counties might adopt. Boards can require that owners not allow their cats to roam about the property. Stray Cats in the Common Areas If there are &quot;homeless&quot; cats that are hungry, people will feed them. Associations can work with pest control to trap the cats and remove them to a shelter. Under the law of unintended consequences, removing the cats may allow the rodent population to increase, so you should set traps for them as well. Some associations have participated in a &quot;Trap Neuter Release&quot; program where they rent traps and then take captured cats to a place called &quot;Fix Nation&quot; where they are spayed &amp; neutered for free. The cats are then returned to their environment the next morning. These fixed cats keep other fertile feral cats away &amp; keep rodent populations down.&nbsp; ASSISTANCE : Associations needing legal assistance can contact us .
