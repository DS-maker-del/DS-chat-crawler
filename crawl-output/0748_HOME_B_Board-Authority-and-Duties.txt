Associations are governed by elected boards of directors who have general duties and authority. ( Civ. Code &sect; 4080 )&nbsp;Corporations are required to have a board of directors: &quot;Each corporation shall have a board of directors.&nbsp;. . . the activities and affairs of a corporation shall be conducted, and all corporate powers shall be exercised by or under the direction of the board.&nbsp;. . . the activities and affairs of the corporation shall be managed and all corporate powers shall be exercised under the ultimate direction of the board.&quot; ( Corp. Code &sect; 7210 ) Boards must manage the affairs of the association in a manner consistent with the CC&amp;Rs. ( Pinnacle Museum Tower Ass&#39;n v. Pinnacle Market Dev&#39;l &nbsp;(2012) 55 Cal.4th 223, 239) Board of Directors Defined . A &quot;Board of Directors&quot; is the elected body that governs a common interest development. The Corporations Code defines &quot;directors&quot; as &quot;natural persons designated...elected or appointed...to act as members of the corporation&#39;s governing body. A person who does not have authority to act as a member of the corporation&#39;s governing body, including through voting rights as a member of the governing body, is not a director...&quot; ( Corp. Code &sect; 5047 )&nbsp;&quot;Board of Governors&quot; is an older term rarely used today. It was used in early common interest developments when they were unincorporated associations. As the industry evolved and the Department of Real Estate required developers to incorporate all new associations, they added bylaws to their CC&amp;Rs and were defined as &quot;boards of directors&quot; instead of boards of governors. Number of Directors . The number of directors elected to a board is established in an association&#39;s articles of incorporation and repeated in the bylaws. The number is almost always odd to avoid deadlocked boards. The number is usually five. Small associations sometimes have three directors, while large associations may have seven or more. See Changing the Number of Directors .&nbsp; BOARD AUTHORITY &quot;Unless the governing documents provide otherwise, and regardless of whether the association is incorporated or unincorporated, the association may exercise the powers granted to a nonprofit mutual benefit corporation, as enumerated in&nbsp; Section 7140 &nbsp;of the Corporations Code.&quot; ( Civ. Code &sect; 4805(a). ) Corporations must have a&nbsp;board of directors&nbsp;who conduct the corporation&#39;s affairs. ( Corp. Code&nbsp;&sect; 7210 .) Because of their positions of authority, boards (and individual&nbsp;directors) are held to a higher standard as&nbsp; fiduciaries . Unless the governing documents provide otherwise, boards can: &nbsp;Adopt and enforce&nbsp; rules and regulations &nbsp; Appoint committees &nbsp; Appoint directors &nbsp;to fill vacancies &nbsp;Approve exceptions to&nbsp; exclusive use easements &nbsp; Borrow money &nbsp; Call membership meetings &nbsp; Appoint inspectors of election &nbsp;Communicate with the&nbsp; association&#39;s attorney &nbsp;Delegate management &nbsp; Disburse reserve monies &nbsp; Elect and remove officers &nbsp; Enforce the governing documents &nbsp; Enter into contracts Establish&nbsp; architectural standards Exercise the powers of a corporation ( Civ. Code &sect; 4805 ;&nbsp; Corp. Code&nbsp;&sect; 7140 ) Hire and fire employees and vendors Initiate and defend lawsuits Insure&nbsp;the association and its directors Invest funds Levy and collect&nbsp; regular,&nbsp;special, and&nbsp;emergency&nbsp;assessments Make limited&nbsp; capital improvements Manage the association Pay expenses incurred by the association Prepare and&nbsp; adopt budgets Repair and maintain &nbsp;the common areas. Board Limitations Boards of directors oversee operations and set policy. Just as boards have limited authority, so do individual directors. Vendors . Directors do not have the right to individually contact vendors, give vendors instructions, or sign contracts without board authorization. Allowing multiple directors to interact with vendors will result in higher costs to the association, conflicting instructions to vendors, and potential loss of vendors. It also creates the potential for&nbsp; ultra vires acts by directors . The proper procedure is to direct matters through the president to the association&#39;s vendors or through its managing agent to vendors. B oards may censure directors who violate these procedures and disrupt operations &nbsp;and may be subject to personal liability for their acts. Personnel . Directors are similarly restricted in their ability to interact with employees. Individual directors do not have the right to direct or discipline employees. That function is reserved for the board or delegated to the president, manager, or managing agent. Allowing individual directors to take such actions invites potential liability via Labor Code violations, harassment issues , and constructive termination actions. Records . Directors have a right to&nbsp;review books and records&nbsp;of the Association, but&nbsp; various factors, including privacy rights, limit that right . Volunteer Limitation s . To maintain their protections as volunteers, directors&nbsp; cannot receive pay &nbsp;for serving on the board. To limit exposure to the association, directors must be cautious about the activities they undertake for the association. Duties of Board Members When a homeowner becomes a board member, he/she assumes certain obligations as a director that must be carried out in the association&#39;s best interests. Fiduciary Duties . Boards of Directors are held to a higher standard and must fulfill their&nbsp; duties of loyalty, due diligence &amp; confidentiality . Impose Assessments . Boards must impose regular and special assessments sufficient to carry out their duties under the governing documents. ( Civ. Code &sect; 5600(a) ) Attend Board Meetings . Directors&nbsp;must a ttend and participate &nbsp;in meetings to be informed about the association&#39;s business. Maintain the Common Areas . Boards must&nbsp; maintain the common areas&nbsp; on behalf of the membership ( Civ. Code &sect; 4775 ) Oversee Finances .&nbsp;Boards must exercise reasonable care when overseeing the association&#39;s finances, including&nbsp; collection policies . Enforce Governing Documents . Boards must enforce the governing documents . Oversee Operations . Boards manage the association&#39;s day-to-day operations. It includes retaining (as needed) management services, legal services, landscape vendors, pest control, operating amenities (pools, tennis courts, clubhouses, equestrian facilities, golf course, etc.), purchasing insurance, etc. Limited Transparency . Because a board&#39;s primary duty is to protect the corporation and its assets, complete transparency with the membership is not feasible. Some information must be kept confidential, which is why the Davis-Stirling Act provides for&nbsp; executive session meetings &nbsp;that allow boards to review matters in confidence. For that reason, the minutes of these meetings are&nbsp; not subject to review &nbsp;by members. FINANCIAL DUTIES Boards must exercise reasonable care when overseeing the association&#39;s money.&nbsp;Following is a summary of their obligations: Bank Accounts. &nbsp;Boards must set up&nbsp; operating and reserve accounts .&nbsp; Reserve Funds . Boards must establish and&nbsp; properly fund reserves &nbsp;for the future repair and replacement of major&nbsp;common components. Approve Fund Transfers . Depending on the amounts, boards must&nbsp; approve the transfer of funds &nbsp;from operating and reserve accounts.&nbsp; Make Prudent Investments .&nbsp;Boards should obtain a reasonable return on the investments&nbsp; without jeopardizing capital . Internal Controls . Boards should establish&nbsp; internal financial controls &nbsp;to prevent embezzlement. Insurance . Boards are required by statute and their CC&amp;Rs to purchase certain&nbsp; kinds and levels of insurance &nbsp;to protect the association against loss.&nbsp; Budget and Assessments. &nbsp;Boards must budget for the association&#39;s financial needs. Collection Policy . Boards must&nbsp;establish and follow strong&nbsp; collection policies . Taxes . Boards must file&nbsp; annual tax returns . Review Financial Records Monthly Boards must maintain accurate financial records, which can be used to generate&nbsp; annual financial statements &nbsp;for&nbsp;the membership. Beginning January 1, 2019, boards of directors must review their association&#39;s financial records&nbsp; every month . ( Civ. Code &sect; 5500 ) Review&nbsp;can be interpreted by its ordinary meaning, &ldquo;to go over and examine critically or deliberately.&rdquo;&nbsp; (Webster&#39;s Dictionary) Directors should review financial statements critically and ask questions whenever something looks amiss or does not make sense. For example, the board should investigate if the check register shows checks issued to a roofer, but no roof work has been authorized.&nbsp; Embezzlement&nbsp; may be occurring.&nbsp;Some association boards only meet quarterly or miss monthly meetings because of holidays. Even so,&nbsp;finances need to be reviewed.&nbsp;Fortunately,&nbsp; Civil Code &sect; 5501 &nbsp;allows the review requirements to be met when: (1) Every member of the board reviews the monthly documents and statements (described above) independent of a board meeting and then ratifies the review at a subsequent board meeting, or (2)&nbsp;A subcommittee of the board consisting of the treasurer and at least one other board member reviews the records and ratifies the review at a subsequent board meeting.&nbsp;The ratification must be reflected in the minutes of the board&#39;s meeting. Review includes: a current reconciliation of the operating accounts, a current reconciliation of the&nbsp;reserve accounts, the current year&#39;s actual operating revenues and expenses compared to the current year&#39;s budget, the latest bank statements for operating and reserve accounts, an income and expense statement for the association&#39;s operating and reserve accounts, and the check register, monthly general ledger, and delinquent assessment receivable reports. DELEGATING AUTHORITY Boards can delegate many of their duties to others. For example, boards can hire a&nbsp; managing agent &nbsp;to conduct the association&#39;s day-to-day operations. The board may delegate the management of the activities of the corporation to any person or persons, management company, or committee, however composed, provided that the activities and affairs of the corporation shall be managed and all corporate powers shall be exercised under the ultimate direction of the board. ( Corp. Code &sect; 7210 ) [D]irectors may delegate their authority to a committee (Corp. Code, &sect;&sect; 300, subd. (a), 311, 7210, 7212, subd. (a); Finley v. Superior Court &nbsp;(2000) 80 Cal.App.4th 1152, 1161) There are various&nbsp; types of committees , any of which the board can delegate authority to or make advisory only. If a board delegates authority to a committee, it should be recorded in meeting minutes. While boards may delegate duties, they remain responsible for the actions of managers and committees acting at their direction. Duties that Cannot be Delegated (Nondelegable Duties) Some duties are nondelegable, i.e., they cannot be assigned or transferred to a person or committee. They include the following: Appointing&nbsp; executive committees &nbsp;or their members ( Corp. Code &sect; 7212(a)(6) ); Approving large transfers of funds ; Approving settlement agreements ( Elnekave v. Via Dolce ); Attending board meetings ; Voting on motions &nbsp;at board meetings; Electing officers ( Corp. Code &sect; 7213(b) ); Filling vacancies &nbsp;on the board ( Corp. Code &sect; 7212(a)(2) ); Reviewing the&nbsp;association&#39;s finances&nbsp;( Civ. Code &sect; 5500 ); The decision to record a lien for delinquent assessments ( Civ. Code &sect; 5673 ); The decision to foreclose on a lien ( Civ. Code &sect; 5705(c) ); The decision to file a lawsuit ( Finley v. Superior Court ). Miscellaneous Judicial Deference . &nbsp;Courts will&nbsp; defer to board decisions , even if they are not the &quot;best&quot; decisions, provided the board made a&nbsp;reasonable investigation&nbsp;and its decision was in good faith with the association&#39;s best interests in mind. ( Business Judgment Rule ) Members who are unhappy with board decisions always have&nbsp; recourse . Membership Rights .
