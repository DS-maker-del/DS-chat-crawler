Paying for Balcony Inspections Because the statutorily required&nbsp;inspection of the structural elements&nbsp;of condominium balconies and other elevated structures is directly related to reserves needed to repair those structures and because the definition of &quot;replacement cost&quot; includes&nbsp; related expenses , inspection costs can be included in an association&#39;s reserve budget. Using reserves to pay for the inspection is not deemed a borrowing. Balcony Inspection Companies&nbsp; Contracts prepared by vendors can sometimes be skewed to protect the vendor. This is normal but not particularly beneficial to the association. Before signing any contracts, boards should make sure legal counsel reviews them.&nbsp;Below is a list of companies that perform inspections of elevated structures. The information was sent to us by readers of our newsletter and should not be construed as an endorsement by ADAMS|STIRLING. Boards must perform their due diligence and ensure the company they hire is licensed and insured. See&nbsp; CONTRACTOR LICENSE CHECK . A7 Group, Inc.
