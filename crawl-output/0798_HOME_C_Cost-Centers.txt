The cost center is created in the CC&amp;Rs and allocates assessments to those owners who benefit from the amenities/services. In its &quot; Operating Cost Manual for Homeowners Associations ,&quot; the DRE states: The &ldquo;cost center&rdquo; term, used for budget purposes, identifies an area of a project used by only some owners within a homeowners&rsquo; association. Typically, this&nbsp;may be a guard gate or recreational facility utilized only&nbsp;by a portion of the association membership. It would be&nbsp;unreasonable in these cases to require all members of the&nbsp;association to contribute to the maintenance of a facility&nbsp;that only benefits a portion of the project.&nbsp; A cost center may also be used for projects with mixed&nbsp;product types. When a project includes both attached&nbsp;and detached units, a cost center can be created to provide&nbsp;for the exterior maintenance of the attached units.&nbsp;Additional maintenance costs for special benefit facilities/ services or exterior maintenance of certain product types&nbsp;within the project may be managed through a cost center&nbsp;or a sub-association. Separate Budget . During the budgeting process, a separate budget is created for the benefited lots or units to address the additional costs.&nbsp;Examples of cost center budget items include: front yard landscape maintenance, shared private access, gated neighborhood within a community,&nbsp;and roof deck for top story units. Legal Fees Cost Center . Legal fees are not a cost center. In an unpublished case ( Coley v. Eskaton ), the Association&rsquo;s CC&amp;Rs defined a cost center related to a portion of the development. The Board decided to create a cost center to cover legal fees. The court concluded it could not because the CC&amp;Rs limited the use of cost centers to &quot;allocate the expenses incurred or to be incurred by the Association to operate, maintain, repair, and replace a particular Common Area Improvement(s) or maintenance areas.&rdquo; Because legal fees do not fall within maintenance activities, the trial court and the court of appeals concluded that the board erred in creating a cost center to cover legal fees.
