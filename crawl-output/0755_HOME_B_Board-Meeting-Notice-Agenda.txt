Open Forum Recording&nbsp;Meetings Agenda Required Starting January 1, 2008, board meeting agendas must be posted along with the notice of meeting--posting them on a bulletin board is allowed, provided it is in a prominent location accessible to all members. ( Civ. Code &sect; 4920 ) The notice and the agenda can be on the same page. The agenda must contain enough information so members can easily understand what will be discussed at the meeting. The descriptions cannot be so generic that members have no idea what business is being conducted by the board. For example, if the board intends to discuss installing a new landscape sprinkler system, re-roofing a building, and repainting the clubhouse, a generic agenda item called &quot;Maintenance&quot; is not enough. No one reading the posted agenda will have any idea what that means. The agenda should list each item of business. Doing so allows&nbsp;members to&nbsp;decide whether to attend and give their opinions during the&nbsp; open forum .&nbsp; Setting Meeting Dates and Times Regular Meeting Dates .&nbsp;&quot;Regular meetings&quot; of the board are regularly scheduled meetings set on a particular day, such as the 2nd Tuesday of each month. Regular meeting&nbsp;dates&nbsp;and&nbsp;times&nbsp;can be established in the&nbsp;bylaws&nbsp;or set by the board if not in the&nbsp;bylaws.&nbsp;The frequency of regular meetings is sometimes established in the&nbsp; association&#39;s bylaws . Most boards meet monthly, which facilitates the monthly&nbsp; financial review requirements &nbsp;of&nbsp; Civil Code &sect; 5500 , as amended in 2019. However, for boards without enough activity to warrant monthly meetings, directors might fulfill those requirements with independent monthly reviews of the financial records and confirm such reviews in quarterly meetings. When setting regular meeting dates and times, directors should be sensitive to the needs of fellow directors and accommodate schedules whenever reasonable. However, boards cannot be held hostage to the schedule of a single director. If a director has difficulty attending because of his work schedule, vacations, or family obligations, he can always participate&nbsp; by phone or videoconference .&nbsp;Since directors must&nbsp; attend meetings , a board member who is too busy to attend regularly should consider resigning &nbsp;so another volunteer can fill the seat. Religious Observance and Holidays . Scheduling meetings for Saturdays or Sundays can sometimes be a problem if any of the directors observe either of the days as part of their religion. No law directly applies to this situation because serving on the board is a volunteer position. Even though&nbsp; Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 &nbsp;does not apply, it requires employers to reasonably accommodate employees&#39; sincerely held religious beliefs unless doing so would impose an undue hardship on the employer.&nbsp;Accommodating a well-recognized religious practice or holiday should be considered when scheduling meetings.&nbsp; Special Meetings . Special board meetings are not regularly scheduled in&nbsp;the bylaws or by the board but&nbsp;can be called as needed. Meeting Times . Meeting times are set by the board for the convenience of director schedules so they can, as volunteers, attend to the association&#39;s business. For many, the time is early evening to allow directors to meet after returning home from work--a 6:00 or 6:30 p.m. meeting time is common. Early morning meetings are not unusual. Directors schedule meetings at 7:30 a.m. to take care of business before going to work. Meeting times are for the convenience of directors who are volunteers, not for the membership. Non-director members of the community who like to sleep in may complain about early morning meetings, but dates and times must accommodate directors and their schedules.&nbsp; Notice to Members Unless the governing documents require a longer notice period, members must be notified of the time and place of board meetings at least four (4) days before the meeting. ( Civ. Code &sect; 4920(a) ) Notice can be given by general delivery. ( Civ. Code &sect; 4920(c) ) Notice, which must include an agenda, may be provided by any of the following methods: Billing Statement . Inclusion in a billing statement. ( Civ. Code &sect; 4045(a) ) Electronic . Email, facsimile, or other electronic means &nbsp;if the recipient has consented, in writing, to that delivery method. ( Civ. Code &sect; 4040 ) Mail . First-class mail, postage prepaid, registered or certified mail, express mail, or overnight delivery by an express service carrier. The document shall be addressed to the recipient at the address last shown on the association&#39;s books. ( Civ. Code &sect; 4040 ) Newsletter . A notice or report mailed or delivered as part of a newsletter, magazine, or other organ regularly sent to members shall constitute written notice or report under this division when addressed and mailed or delivered to the member, or in the case of members who are residents of the same household and who have the same address on the books of the corporation, when addressed and mailed or delivered to one of such members, at the address appearing on the books of the corporation. ( Corp. Code &sect; 5016 ; Civ. Code &sect; 4040 ) Posted in a Prominent Location . Notices may&nbsp;be posted&nbsp;in a prominent location accessible to all members, provided the association designated the&nbsp;location in its&nbsp;annual policy statement.&nbsp;( Civ. Code &sect; 4045(a)(3) ) Website . Associations can post notices on a website if the notices are in a&nbsp;prominent location accessible to all members and, if so, designated in its&nbsp;annual policy statement. ( Civ. Code &sect; 4045(a)(5) ) Request for Individual Notice .&nbsp;Although general notice requirements&nbsp;can be satisfied by a posting in a prominent location accessible to all members, members can request that board meeting notices be given to them directly. ( Civ. Code &sect; 4045(b) ) Owners can require that notice be delivered by first-class mail or email. ( Civ. Code &sect; 4040(a) ) Associations are required to alert members to this option in their&nbsp; annual policy statement . ( Civ. Code &sect; 5310 ) Types of Meetings . There are different notice requirements for emergency meetings , executive session meetings , and membership meetings . In addition, if the meeting will be held entirely by video or teleconference , additional instructions must be included in the meeting notice. Calculating Notice Deadline . See the &quot; How to Calculate Notice Requirements .&quot; Notice to Directors Requirements for giving notice to board members are normally found in the association&#39;s articles of incorporation&nbsp;or bylaws. If the governing documents do not contain notice provisions,&nbsp; Corporations Code &sect; 7211(a) &nbsp;provides for the following: Regular Meetings. &nbsp;Regular board&nbsp;meetings may be held without notice to the directors if their time and place are fixed by the bylaws or by decision of the board, such as &quot;6:00 p.m. on the second Tuesday of each month.&quot; &nbsp; Special Meetings. &nbsp;Special board&nbsp;meetings require four days&#39; notice to directors by first-class mail or 48 hours&#39; notice delivered personally or by telephone, including a voice messaging system or other system or technology designed to record and communicate messages, telegraph, facsimile, electronic mail, or other electronic means. &nbsp; Emergency Meetings . Emergency meetings may be held with whatever notice may be practicable&nbsp;under the circumstances. Individual directors may waive any required notice. ( Corp. Code &sect; 7211(a)(3) ) See&nbsp; membership notice &nbsp;requirements. Meeting Location The venue or location for board meetings is often required by the&nbsp;bylaws&nbsp;or the&nbsp;articles of incorporation&nbsp;to be &quot;at or near the development.&quot; However, the governing documents are sometimes silent. In that case, the Corporations Code states that: Meetings of the board may be held at any place within or without the state that has been designated in the notice of the meeting or, if not stated in the notice or if there is no notice&nbsp;designated in the&nbsp;bylaws&nbsp;or by resolution of the board. ( Corp. Code &sect; 7211(a)(5) ) If boards are meeting in obscure locations to discourage membership attendance, the membership has recourse by (i) electing boards that are more responsive to the membership&#39;s interests or (ii) amending the&nbsp;bylaws&nbsp;to require that meetings be held in the development (provided facilities are available). Offsite Facilities . Many associations do not have adequate meeting facilities in the development, so they meet at a local library, church, community facility, or restaurant. If management company offices are available, meetings can be held there. Virtual Meetings . Whenever appropriate, boards should consider setting up&nbsp; virtual meetings . Setting the Agenda When it comes to setting board meeting agendas, all directors have a right to bring business before the board. Except for&nbsp; decisions previously made &nbsp;by the board, the president cannot choke off the board&#39;s business by refusing to list matters on the agenda. Any director can make a motion and put an action item on the next meeting agenda. If the motion is adopted by a majority of directors, that item must appear on the next agenda. Owner Requests . Members can request that an action item be placed on the agenda. Since boards, not members, set their own meeting agendas, placing the request on the agenda is at the board&#39;s discretion.&nbsp; Limited to the Agenda Civil Code &sect; 4930(a) &nbsp;restricts boards from discussing or taking action on any item at a non-emergency meeting unless the item was placed on the&nbsp; meeting agenda &nbsp;included in the notice given to the membership. Exceptions to Agenda Limitation . As provided in&nbsp; Civil Code &sect; 4930(d) ,&nbsp;boards may take action on any item of business not appearing on the agenda under the following conditions: Emergency . Upon a determination made by a majority of the board of directors present at the meeting that an emergency exists. An emergency exists if there are circumstances that could not have been reasonably foreseen by the board, that require immediate attention and possible action by the board, and that, of necessity, make it impracticable to provide notice. ( Civ. Code &sect; 4930(d)(1) ) Immediate Action . &nbsp;Upon a determination made by the board by a vote of two-thirds of the members present at the meeting, or, if less than two-thirds of the total membership of the board is present at the meeting, by a unanimous vote of the members present, that there is a need to take immediate action and that the need for action came to the attention of the board after the agenda was properly posted and distributed. Prior Meeting Agenda . &nbsp;The item appeared on an agenda that was&nbsp; posted and distributed &nbsp;for a prior meeting of the board of directors that occurred not more than 30 calendar days before the date that action was taken on the item, and, at the preceding meeting, action on the item was continued to the meeting at which the action was taken. Items Not on the Agenda . &nbsp;With the following exceptions, boards are not allowed to discuss or take action on any item not on the agenda. As provided for in&nbsp; Civil Code&nbsp;&sect; 4930(a) : Reports . Board members and their agents (including managers) may briefly respond to statements or questions from association members, ask clarifying questions, make brief announcements, or make brief reports on their activities. &nbsp; Administrative . Boards may refer certain informational matters and administrative tasks to their managers, agents, and staff--even if these items were not listed on the agenda. Consent Agenda Boards are allowed to include &quot;consent agenda&quot; items in their meeting agenda, that is,&nbsp;a grouping of non-controversial agenda items expected to be approved by the board without discussion. ( RONR (12th ed.) 41:32 )&nbsp;As such, it can be a significant time saver for board meetings.&nbsp;Routine items can be grouped together on the agenda with a heading of &quot;consent calendar&quot; or &quot;consent agenda.&quot; When the board reaches that portion of the agenda, the chair asks if any member wishes to remove (or pull) any item from the consent agenda. They may do so by stating, &quot;I pull item #____.&quot; Pulling an item does not require a second. After all the &quot;pulls&quot; are made, the chair states, &quot;Without objection, the remaining items (or all the items if none have been pulled) are adopted by general consent.&quot;&nbsp;If any director wants to vote against an item, he/she must pull it from the consent agenda. This is a case where silence not only implies consent; silence&nbsp; is &nbsp;consent. If any items are pulled, the board can either take them up immediately for discussion and a vote or put them in their appropriate place on the agenda. Executive Session . &nbsp;Notice of&nbsp; executive session meetings &nbsp;must also contain an agenda. ( Civ. Code&nbsp;&sect; 4920(d) ) Because executive sessions are confidential and topics are generally noted in open meeting minutes ( Civ. Code&nbsp;&sect; 4935(e) ), agenda descriptions are more circumspect. ASSISTANCE : Associations needing legal assistance can contact us .
