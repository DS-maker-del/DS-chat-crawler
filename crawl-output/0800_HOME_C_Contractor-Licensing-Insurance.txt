( State Compensation Ins. Fund v. Workers&#39; Comp. Appeals Board &nbsp; (1985) 40 Cal.3d 5) This is true even if the contractor misrepresented that he was licensed and insured. Without workers&#39; compensation insurance, there are no limits on the damages that may be claimed by an injured employee, including claims for pain and suffering. The association could be liable, and the membership could face large special assessments to pay the damages. With insurance, the employee&#39;s claims are limited, and the loss is paid by insurance. In&nbsp; Heiman v. Workers Comp Appeals Board &nbsp;(2007), the Montana Villas Homeowners Association hired Pegasus Properties as its management company. Pegasus hired Hruby, a contractor, to install rain gutters for the association. Hruby&#39;s employee was careless, and a rain gutter touched a high-voltage electrical wire, severely injuring the employee. Since Hruby was unlicensed and uninsured, the court concluded that both the association and its management company were the employers of the injured worker and both were liable to pay him workers&#39; compensation benefits. Unpaid Wages. &nbsp;If associations hire unlicensed contractors, they could be liable for wage and hour claims filed by the contractors&#39; employees.&nbsp;In a 2009 case involving a general contractor and its subcontractors, associations who hire unlicensed contractors can be deemed a &quot;general contractor&quot; and the unlicensed contractors as &quot;subcontractors.&quot; It means that any unpaid workers will be considered employees of the association, and the association will be liable for paying those workers, even if the association has already paid the contractor. ( Sanders Construction v. Cerda&nbsp; (2009) 175 Cal.App.4th 430.) Licensed but Uninsured Vendors. &nbsp; Typically, as long as the vendor is licensed, the injured worker will remain the vendor&#39;s employee, not the association. Accordingly, the injured worker could proceed against the vendor either civilly or for workers&#39; compensation. If there was a finding of dual employment, then the association becomes liable. So long as the association is insured for workers&#39; compensation, the injured worker&#39;s remedy would be limited to workers&#39; compensation. If the association is not insured, the injured worker can pursue the association civilly and under workers&#39; compensation. Contractor License Numbering Anyone who contracts to perform work valued at $500 or more for materials and labor must hold a current, valid license in the specialty for which he/she is contracting. Section 7030.5 of the California Business and Professions Code requires that licensed contractors include their license number in &ldquo;(a) all construction contracts; (b) subcontracts and calls for bid; and (c) all forms advertising, as prescribed by the register of contractors, used by such person.&rdquo;&nbsp;A contractor&#39;s license can be verified through the Contractor License Board .
