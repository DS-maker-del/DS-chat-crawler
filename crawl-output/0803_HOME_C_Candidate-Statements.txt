The California Elections Code &sect; 13308 &nbsp;can be used as a model when it comes to candidate statements. The&nbsp;same limitations applied to public elections can be applied to association elections. Candidate statements should not advocate a point of view or campaign for election. As part of the election package to the membership, associations can limit candidate statements to the person&#39;s qualifications to serve on the board. In a California Supreme Court decision, the Court ruled that a statute restricting the content of a candidate&#39;s statement for inclusion in the voter information guide to a brief description of the candidate&#39;s age, occupation, and a brief description of the candidate&rsquo;s background and qualifications does not violate the First Amendment free speech nor the 14th Amendment&#39;s equal protection clause. ( Clark v&nbsp;Burleigh (1992) 4 Cal.4th 474 )&nbsp;If candidates were allowed to advocate a position or campaign in their statements, it would create the following potential problems: defamatory statements by candidates could open the association to litigation (even though the association should be able to defeat the claim, it still must endure the litigation); &nbsp; other candidates may demand rebuttal statements in the same mailing; and &nbsp; material advocating a point of view about the election mailed at the association&#39;s expense opens the door to&nbsp;equal access&nbsp;by all members who want materials mailed at the association&#39;s expense.&nbsp;( Civ. Code &sect; 5105(a) ) Arroyo v. Pacific Ridge . In a December 1, 2025 decision, the Court of Appeal ruled that candidate statements included in ballot materials amounted to advocacy, thereby opening the door to equal access to the association&#39;s media. If a candidate&#39;s statement is intended to convince members to vote for him/her, it violates Civil Code&nbsp;&sect; 5105 . ( Arroyo v. Pacific Ridge ) As stated above, associations should adopt ELECTION RULES that limit candidate statements to their bios only. Candidates cannot state what they hope to achieve once in office, such as lowering dues, increasing reserves, refurbishing the playground, etc. If candidates want to let members know their goals for the association, they can do so in separate mailings to the membership, in fliers, at town hall meetings, and in email blasts at their own expense.&nbsp; Return Nonconforming Statements Because associations are prohibited from editing or redacting* material in a candidate&#39;s statement ( Civ. Code &sect; 5105(a) ), if a candidate submits a statement that does not conform to the association&#39;s requirements, the statement can be returned with a request that a conforming one be submitted. If the candidate refuses, the association should not publish the nonconforming statement. The election package can be mailed without the candidate&#39;s statement, but with the other candidates&#39; statements.&nbsp; False Bios . &nbsp;If a candidate puffs their resume or lies about their background, it should not be rejected. The bio should be included in the ballot materials. Other candidates and homeowners can point out during the campaign that the candidate lied about his/her background. Members can then decide whether they want to elect the person to the board.&nbsp; *To &quot;redact&quot; is to blacken or strike through language in a document so it cannot be read. Candidates&#39; Forum So members can meet the candidates and hear their positions, associations can schedule a &quot; Candidates&#39; Forum &quot; or &quot;Meet the Candidates&quot; Town Hall meeting without violating the restriction on association media, since everyone will have an opportunity to speak.&nbsp; ASSISTANCE : Associations needing legal assistance can contact us .
