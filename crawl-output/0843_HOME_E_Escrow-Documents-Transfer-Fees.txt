( Civ. Code &sect; 4530(a) ) Documents provided to a prospective purchaser are specified in Civil Code &sect; 4525 .&nbsp;Associations can charge a reasonable fee &quot;based upon the association&rsquo;s actual cost for the procurement, preparation, reproduction, and delivery of the documents requested.&quot; ( Civ. Code &sect; 4530(b) ) If the production of documents is handled by the association&#39;s management company, the company is allowed to include a profit component to its fees.&nbsp;( Berryman v. Merit Management ; Fowler v. M&amp;C Mgmt ) Transfer Fees Associations are allowed to charge transfer fees. ( Corp. Code &sect; 7140(g) ), A &ldquo;transfer fee&rdquo; is any fee affecting the transfer or sale of real property that requires a fee to be paid as a result of the transfer of the real property. ( Civ. Code&nbsp;&sect; 1098 ) It does not include&nbsp;Assessments, charges, penalties, or fees authorized by the Davis-Stirling Common Interest Development Act. ( Civ. Code&nbsp;&sect; 1098 (a)(7))&nbsp;&nbsp; However, an association cannot charge an amount that exceeds its actual costs to change its records ( Civ. Code &sect; 4575(a) ) or to defray the costs for which they are levied ( Civ. Code &sect; 5600 ). &nbsp;Nor can it impose an assessment or fee in connection with the marketing of an owner&rsquo;s interest in an amount that exceeds the association&rsquo;s actual or direct costs. ( Civ. Code &sect; 4730(b)(1) ) Document Disclosure Form .&nbsp;Associations must use a form prescribed by statute to list the documents being delivered to escrow and the fee for each document. The form is found in Civil Code &sect; 4528 . The seller is responsible for compensating the association, person, or entity that provides the documents. ( Civ. Code &sect; 4530(b)(8) ) Fee Justification Associations should be prepared to provide an itemized breakdown to support their fees. Reasonable expenses might include the following: Copy costs for governing documents ( Civ. Code &sect; 4525 ), Copy costs for the financial documents per &sect; 5300 (as required by Civ. Code &sect; 4525 ), Copy costs for a preliminary list of construction defects provided to members ( Civ. Code &sect; 4525(a)(6) ), Copy costs for a general description of defects the association believes will be corrected or replaced and an estimate of when the defects will be corrected per &sect; 6100 (as required by Civ. Code &sect; 4525(a)(7) ), Copy costs for meeting minutes , Document delivery fees, Cost to close out old files, Cost to set up new files, including emergency information and/or security cards, Cost of attorney litigation disclosure letter (if any), Fee to change security systems (if any), Fee to inspect the property and/or documents for rules violations ( Civ. Code &sect; 4525(a)(5) ), Fee to answer lender forms, Fee to answer escrow forms, and Fee to certify assessments ( Civ. Code &sect; 4525(a)(4) ). Reasonable Approximation Allowed . Because it may be impossible to establish an exact incremental cost for each element of a transfer fee, an approximation is allowed. Once a reasonable average has been established, the&nbsp;fee can be uniformly applied to all persons who move in or out of the development. ( Watts v. Oak Shores )&nbsp;It is sufficient if the association demonstrates a rough proportionality &nbsp;between the fees charged and the association&#39;s actual costs.)&nbsp; Transfer of Membership &nbsp; Community Apartment Project Condominium Project Planned Development Stock Cooperative ASSISTANCE : Associations needing legal assistance can contact us .
