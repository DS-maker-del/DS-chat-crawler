( Liebler v. Point Loma ) As a result, absentee owners do not have the right to keys to recreational facilities. If both owners and tenants have access, it increases the load on those amenities. Accordingly, associations can limit the distribution of keys to pools, clubhouses, tennis courts, etc. Landlord Rights Even though associations can restrict access to amenities, absentee owners still have the right to enter the development to inspect and maintain their separate interests. Absentee owners may be entitled to lobby keys, gate keys, codes for keyless entry, and remote-control codes or devices for gated communities, but not keys to the clubhouse or pool. Associations can charge members for extra sets of keys beyond the normal allotment.&nbsp;The transfer of common area rights does not mean the right to attend board and annual meetings. Absentee owners retain those rights along with the right to vote on matters presented to the membership. Following is a chart showing which rights are transferred from the owner to the renter. An &quot;X&quot; in the Owner column means the right is retained by the owner. An &quot;X&quot; in the Renter column means the owner&#39;s right is transferred from the owner to the renter. &nbsp; &nbsp; OWNER&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; RENTER &nbsp; ADR - IDR rights X &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Amenity use rights &amp; keys --► &nbsp; &nbsp;X &nbsp; Attend board meetings X &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Attend membership meetings X &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Authorize visitors --► &nbsp; X &nbsp; Ingress-egress rights X &nbsp; X &nbsp; Pets X &nbsp; possibly &nbsp; Right to vote in elections X &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ASSISTANCE : Associations needing legal assistance can contact us .
