Many HOAs allow owners with children to have parties and hire jumpers to place in the common area. ANSWER : Yes, they can be banned. Regarding the common areas, boards have the power to regulate activities. They can do so because governing documents put common areas under HOA control, and reducing liability is a key element of a board&#39;s duties. Injuries to Children . According to the Consumer Product Safety Commission, injuries related to bouncers are on the rise. They estimate more than 100,000 bouncer-related injuries were treated in emergency rooms from 2003 to 2013, including 12 deaths. The Child Injury Prevention Alliance noted that inflatable bouncers can lead to broken bones and concussions and estimated that hospital emergency visits are now at &quot;more than 30 children a day, or about one child every 45 minutes.&quot; Potential HOA Liability . If an owner holds a bounce party in his backyard and a child is injured, the association won&#39;t be dragged into the litigation. However, if the party is in the common areas, the association can be sued even though it was the owner&#39;s party. Accordingly, boards are interested in protecting the association from potential liability related to bouncers. Adopt Rules . Associations don&#39;t necessarily need a rule banning bouncers since a list of prohibited activities could be lengthy--no bouncers, no trampolines, no archery, no weapons, no serving alcohol to minors, no dangerous activities, etc. In addition to being lengthy, such restrictions can be difficult to define. Is running across a greenbelt a hazardous activity and therefore banned? Is using a stick to hit a pinata a weapon? Even so, a short list of prohibited activities may be appropriate. Recommendation : Associations with common areas that lend themselves to children&#39;s events should talk to legal counsel about limiting liability for such events. That could include insurance and a signed&nbsp; hold harmless/indemnity &nbsp;agreement. In addition, boards can adopt a list of the more dangerous activities they wish to restrict and incorporate it into the reservation agreement so members will know in advance what they can and cannot do. Boards need to be cautious about how they word restrictions. Otherwise, they could trigger&nbsp; discrimination claims &nbsp;against families with children.
