( Civ. Code &sect; 5125 ) Starting January 1, 2020, members are allowed to inspect election materials . ( Civ. Code &sect; 5200(c) ) Election materials include:&nbsp;candidate registration list,&nbsp;voter list,&nbsp;ballots,&nbsp;signed voter envelopes (may be inspected but not copied), and&nbsp;proxies Approve Annual Meeting Minutes Under Robert&#39;s Rules of Order, the board may approve minutes that do not come up for review quarterly. Since annual meetings are once a year, the board can approve the minutes. &quot;Minutes of one annual meeting should not be held for action until the next one a year later.&quot; ( RONR (12th ed.) 9:22 )&nbsp;They can be approved by the board of directors. ( RONR (12th ed.) 48:12 )&nbsp;The best way to accomplish this is to have the board of directors approve the minutes of the annual membership meeting at the first regular board meeting that follows the annual membership meeting (or if that first board meeting is the same day as the annual membership meeting, then the regular board meeting after that first board meeting). This is consistent with the Corporations Code, allowing the minutes to be approved promptly and without needing a quorum at the following year&#39;s membership meeting. An added benefit is that what occurred at the meeting will be fresh in the directors&#39; minds, which ensures more accurate minutes.
