ADA regulations require that public swimming pools have a second means of access, such a pool lift or ramp, for the disabled. This requirement does not apply to HOA swimming pools unless the association has opened its pool to the public. Even so, if a disabled person wants to install a lift so he/she can use the pool, and is willing to do so at their expense, the board should allow it. Boards are required to reasonably accommodate requests whenever possible.&nbsp; When ADA Compliance is Required .&nbsp;If an association rents its pool facilities to the public, such as for weddings, parties, etc., it will need handicap access at least for the duration of the event. That can be accomplished with a portable chair lift. If guests are not using the pool, other facilities such as bathrooms may need to be modified for handicap access under other provisions of Title III.&nbsp;If an association rents its facilities to members only, ADA requirements do not apply.&nbsp;Because association residents are allowed to invite guests without triggering &quot;public accommodation&quot; ADA rules, does that apply to &quot;guest&quot; swim teams? Some argue that a swimming competition event in the association&#39;s pool is private because only invited guests can attend the event. The general public is not invited. A counter-argument can be made that swim meets are &quot;public&quot; events because those attending the event (swimmers, coaches, family members and other spectators) are not all known to members of the association--many or most of them are strangers. The public event argument is much stronger if attendees are charged a fee. ( Carolyn v. Orange Park ) A case that addresses the issue of public versus non-public facilities is &nbsp; Jankey v. Twentieth Century Fox . Animals in the Pool Area EXCEPT for service animals , associations can prohibit animals from pool areas. If someone is blind and needs their guide dog to safely maneuver to a lounge chair, the association cannot prohibit the dog.&nbsp;An animal in the water is a different matter. According to the ADA&#39;s website, the ADA does not override public health rules that prohibit dogs in swimming pools. However, service animals must be allowed on the pool deck and in other areas where the public can go.&nbsp;If someone legitimately needs the emotional support of a comfort animal to use the pool, the animal can be brought into the pool area but not the pool itself. Only service animals properly trained to assist a disabled person in swimming can go into the water. Even so, reasonable restrictions may be imposed regarding the protection of pool filters from animal fur and proper sanitation. ASSISTANCE : Associations needing legal assistance can contact us .
