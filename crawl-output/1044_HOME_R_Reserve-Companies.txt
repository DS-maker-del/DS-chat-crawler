That means a CPA, a manager, or the board could perform it. However, an independent, credentialed reserve analyst is the best option for three reasons: Expertise. Boards rarely have the expertise to evaluate a component&#39;s condition, its remaining life, and the cost of replacing it. &nbsp; Liability. Boards should not take on potential liability. There is much less exposure to associations and boards to have an independent, credentialed specialist prepare the study. Depending on the extent of the common areas, preparing reserve studies internally arguably violates the&nbsp; Business Judgment Rule . &nbsp; Politics. Having a specialist prepare the study also saves the board a lot of criticism. Homeowners who dislike the board will often challenge in-house studies by the board or a manager. Using a specialist eliminates such criticism. The arguments for an independent professional are stronger when the association needs a &ldquo;full&rdquo; or &ldquo;update with-site-visit&rdquo; reserve study. Less sensitive &ldquo;update no-site-visit&rdquo; reserve study projects tend to be much simpler and less of a problem if done internally. Boards should ask prospective reserve study companies (i) if they are credentialed&nbsp;and (ii) how long they have been performing studies. Do they follow&nbsp; National Reserve Study Standards ? The Community Associations Institute (CAI) issues a &quot;Reserve Specialist&quot; credential to qualified individuals. A similar credential is called the &quot; Professional Reserve Analyst ,&quot; administered by the Association of Professional Reserve Analysts.
