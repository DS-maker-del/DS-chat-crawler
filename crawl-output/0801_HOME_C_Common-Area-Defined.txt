( Civ. Code &sect; 4095(a) ;&nbsp; Pinnacle Museum Tower v. Pinnacle Market Dev&#39;l ) The general definition of common area is a little easier to understand. Common areas are amenities and spaces that are open to use by association members. It can also include areas owned in common but not open for general use, such as restricted open space set aside as a natural habitat.&nbsp;Common areas can also be set aside for the exclusive use of a particular owner, such as a balcony.&nbsp; Associations are created for the purpose of managing and maintaining common areas. Part of managing common areas is insuring the common areas .&nbsp; &nbsp; Purpose of Associations Planned Development Common Areas In a planned development , members own their houses as well as the lots upon which their houses are built. The association&rsquo;s common areas will&nbsp;consist of amenities such as: clubhouses swimming pools tennis courts hiking trails greenbelts and open areas private streets equestrian facilities playgrounds lakes in some planned developments, common areas may consist entirely as reciprocal easements Ownership . Ownership of common areas in a planned development can be shared by all owners, or owned by the association as a corporate entity. Condominium Development Common Areas In a condominium association , members own airspace as defined in a condominium plan. The&nbsp;common areas may include: elevators fitness centers swimming pools tennis courts hallways and lobbies laundry facilities parking areas parking spaces storage areas buildings that house condominiums electrical and plumbing in the walls the project&#39;s real property&nbsp; Ownership . In a condominium association, ownership of the common areas is held by all members as an undivided fractional interest.&nbsp; ASSISTANCE : Associations needing legal assistance can contact us .
