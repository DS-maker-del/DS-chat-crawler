The legal structure for townhouses can be condominiums or single-family residences in a planned development . If they are legally defined as condominiums, the homeowner owns air space and the townhouse and the lot upon which it was built is owned in common. If the association is a planned development, the homeowner owns the townhouse and the lot upon which it is built. Townhouse Construction What makes a townhouse distinctive is its construction. Townhouses are individual residences attached to each other via a party wall , i.e., a row of homes sharing common walls. Townhouses have no neighbors above or below, only side-to-side. They are generally two or three stories tall. Zero-Lot-Line Homes A variation is the &quot;zero-lot-line&quot; single-family home. In a planned development with zero lot lines, houses can be placed on the property line. It creates a higher density of housing. Houses are not physically attached to each other. Instead, they are separated by a small space. They are sometimes referred to as &quot;row houses,&quot; such as the ones on the left found in San Francisco.
