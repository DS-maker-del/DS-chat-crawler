The statute defines a clothesline to include a cord, rope, or wire from which laundered items may be hung to dry. Fortunately, the bill specifically prohibits a balcony, railing, awning, or other part of a structure from qualifying as a clothesline. ( Civ. Code &sect; 4753 ) Reasonable Restrictions . Associations can adopt reasonable restrictions on clotheslines and drying racks. It defines &quot;reasonable restriction&quot; as one that does not significantly increase the cost of using a clothesline or drying rack. Recommendation : If boards want to regulate clotheslines, they need to amend their rules . At some point, associations will also need to amend their CC&amp;Rs to remove clothesline prohibitions. Backyard Gardens Starting January 1, 2015, association residents can plant personal use food gardens in their exclusive use backyards regardless of any restrictions in the governing documents. ( Civ. Code &sect; 4750 ) Crops cannot be used for commercial purposes or to be sold on the property. The change in law does not authorize the&nbsp; growing of marijuana &nbsp;or other non-food crops. ( Civ. Code &sect; 1940.10(a)(3) ) Associations can adopt reasonable rules and regulations related to the placement and maintenance of the gardens. ( Civ. Code &sect; 4750(e) ;&nbsp; &sect; 1940.10(d) ) ASSISTANCE : Associations needing legal assistance can contact us .
