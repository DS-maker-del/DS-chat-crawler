Some argue the installation of speed bumps is a&nbsp; capital improvement , i.e., the addition of a component that did not previously exist. As such, their installation cannot be funded from reserves since reserve monies are set aside for existing common area components. Funding from Reserves . However, private streets are existing reserve items and should include safety features such as reflectors, striping, signage and the like. These are components that legitimately fall within the discretion of the board of directors. If the cost to install speed bumps is reasonable, it could justifiably come from street reserves. If the cost is significant and reserves are insufficient, it would require a&nbsp; special assessment &nbsp;to pay for the installation of speed bumps. If a safety concern can reasonably be demonstrated and the cost to install is a small percentage of the street funds, I suspect a judge would side with the board on using reserve funds for that purpose. Fire Department . Before installing speed bumps, associations should contact appropriate fire authorities. They have jurisdiction over their installation since it may affect their response time to a fire. They may require particular size, placement, signage, and striping. Insurance . An association&#39;s existing insurance should cover any injuries or damage related to the speed bumps. At the time of this writing, Farmers Insurance covers an association that gets sued due to an accident related to speed bumps, regardless if the speed bumps were present at the time the policy was written or installed subsequent to policy inception. Under their policy, boards do not need to make changes to the policy in order to be covered.&nbsp;Boards should notify the association&#39;s insurance agent of the installation to make sure they are covered and to find out if the insurance carrier has guidelines about how the speed bumps should be marked so as to minimize risk. For example, Farmers provides a&nbsp; Loss Control Guide &nbsp;that property managers and directors can use when evaluating potential hazards on the property. It includes a checklist that asks if speed bumps are installed in necessary areas and painted a contrasting color so that they are clearly visible to drivers.
