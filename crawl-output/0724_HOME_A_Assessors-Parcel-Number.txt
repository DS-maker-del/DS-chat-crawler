Most county assessors provide an online searchable database. Searches can be done by parcel number and address. The Davis-Stirling Act references parcel numbers in the following statutes: Decision to Lien . The decision by the board to record a lien against a delinquent member&#39;s property must be made in an open meeting and recorded in the minutes of that meeting. ( Civ. Code&nbsp; &sect; 5673 .) Even though the statute does not require confidentiality, it is recommended that boards use non-identifiable information, such as account numbers, in their resolutions to lien. Decision to Foreclose . &quot;The board shall approve the decision by a majority vote of the directors in an executive session. The board shall record the vote in the minutes of the next meeting of the board open to all members. The board shall maintain the confidentiality of the owner or owners of the separate interest by identifying the matter in the minutes by the parcel number of the property, rather than the name of the owner or owners.&quot; ( Civ. Code &sect; 5705(c) .)&nbsp; Recording Management Information . To facilitate the collection of assessments, the board may record a statement with the County Recorder, listing separate interests subject to assessment by the association, which includes the assessor&#39;s parcel number or legal description, or both, of the separate interests. ( Civ Code &sect; 4210 .) Voting Procedure . &quot;Ballots and two preaddressed envelopes with instructions on how to return ballots shall be mailed by first-class mail or delivered by the association to every member not less than 30 days before the deadline for voting. To preserve confidentiality, a voter may not be identified by name, address, or lot, parcel, or unit number on the ballot.&quot; ( Civ. Code &sect; 5115(a) .)
