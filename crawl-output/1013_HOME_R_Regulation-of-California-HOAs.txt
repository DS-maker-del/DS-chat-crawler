According to their website ( www.leginfo.legislature.ca.gov ), homeowners should use a&nbsp;private attorney for complaints involving: The Davis-Stirling Common Interest Development Act&nbsp;(California Civil Code section 4000 et seq.) The HOA&#39;s rules, commonly referred to as Covenants, Conditions and Restrictions (CC&amp;Rs) Services and amenities, or maintenance issues Property management companies Accountability for common interest assets, i.e., landscaping, pools, and clubhouses Parking and the towing of vehicles Dues, assessments, and citations Costs related to written document production requests, such as copying or redaction fees Foreclosure proceedings Poor management, misappropriation, or negligent handling of corporate assets Department of Real Estate and HOAs The Department of Real Estate does not regulate homeowner associations or their management companies, nor does it have jurisdiction over the enforcement of CC&amp;Rs, bylaws , or Civil Code sections. The DRE is a licensing and regulatory agency empowered to discipline real estate brokers and agents. The DRE is also involved in overseeing developers of common interest developments. Once a developer turns over control of an association to its members, DRE&#39;s oversight ends. Davis-Stirling Act The Davis-Stirling Act is the primary body of law regulating how community associations operate. It covers matters such as budgets and reserves, financial oversight, collection of assessments, maintenance, rules enforcement, board meetings, elections, recordkeeping, dispute resolution, etc. Enforcement of the regulations is through the courts. Corporations Code and HOAs The Corporations Code is a secondary source that serves as a &quot;gap filler&quot; to address matters not covered by the Davis-Stirling Act or an association&#39;s bylaws . Enforcement is through the Office of the Attorney General or the courts. Court Regulation of HOAs Although the courts are not regulatory agencies, they can be used to sort out the legal rights and duties of parties, provide injunctive relief , and award damages. Some matters involving the Davis-Stirling Act can be addressed by small claims courts , while others must be addressed through superior courts (following an offer of alternative dispute resolution ).
