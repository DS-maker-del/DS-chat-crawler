Open Forum Recording&nbsp;Meetings Members Only Can Attend Meetings (with exceptions) California&#39;s community associations are not part of the public sector; they are private membership organizations. As a result, the general public does not have a right to attend board or membership meetings. Unless an association&#39;s governing documents provide otherwise, the legal right to attend meetings as provided for in the Open Meeting Act is reserved for members only. ( Civ. Code &sect; 4925 ) Spouses . Although the legal right to attend board and membership meetings is reserved for members only, industry practice is to allow non-member spouses to attend board meetings. A misbehaving spouse can be excluded for disruptive behavior. Renters . Because they are not members, renters do not have a legal right to attend board meetings. However, most boards allow tenants to attend board meetings and address the board during Open Forum , provided they are not disruptive. Realtors . Nonmember Realtors do not have a legal right to attend board meetings even though they may do business in the development. At the board&#39;s discretion, however, they may attend. Attorney in Fact/Power of Attorney .&nbsp;An attorney-in-fact or power of attorney &nbsp;is an agent authorized to act on behalf of and make legally binding decisions on behalf of another person&nbsp;but not necessarily authorized to practice law. An attorney-in-fact can manage investments, make health decisions, and do other tasks on someone else&#39;s behalf but cannot change a will or trust. To attend meetings, the person must provide the association with a copy of the power of attorney. Lawyers . Attending board meetings is reserved to members only. ( Civ. Code &sect; 4925 ) Industry practice is to prohibit non-member lawyers from attending board and membership meetings. ( SB Liberty v. Isla Verde ) Members cannot avoid the exclusion by sending their lawyer with a &quot;proxy&quot; since proxies apply only to membership meetings, not board meetings. Moreover, proxies for membership meetings are restricted to members. ( Civ. Code &sect; 5130(a)(1) )&nbsp;Lawyers who are members of the association may attend board meetings provided they are attending in their capacity as members, not lawyers. Lawyers who attend board or membership meetings on behalf of a client in litigation with the association or threatening litigation or engaged in other matters before the board could be subject to discipline by the State Bar for violation of&nbsp; Rules of Professional Conduct 2-100. Interpreters . Associations&nbsp;are not required to provide an interpreter for attendees who speak other languages. If a member does not speak English and wants to bring an interpreter to board meetings, they may do so at their own expense. Boards should not exclude an interpreter because the person is not an association member. (An interpreter is a person who converts spoken words from one language to another. A translator is a person who converts written words from one language to another.) Sign Language . if a deaf member wants to bring a sign language interpreter to meetings, the association must reasonably accommodate the request. Associations do not have a duty to pay for the interpreter. (Terminology: &quot; Hearing impaired &quot; describes people with any degree of hearing loss, from mild to severe.&nbsp;&quot; Hard of hearin g&quot; refers to a hearing loss where there may be hearing that can be improved with the assistance of a hearing aid.&nbsp;&quot; Deaf &quot; refers to someone with a hearing loss so severe that they cannot hear and are dependent on visual communication such as sign language and lipreading.) Disruptive Attendees For disruptive attendees who shout, use profanity, or interfere with board meetings, the board may: Impose penalties after appropriate&nbsp; due process , provided the board first adopts &quot; rules of conduct &quot; for its meetings, such as: &quot;No audio or video recording is allowed by attendees. However, the secretary may record the meeting to aid in the preparation of minutes.&nbsp;The recording is deleted once the minutes have been prepared.&nbsp;As provided in the &quot;Open Meeting Act,&quot; members may observe the meeting but do not have the right to participate in the board&#39;s deliberations or votes. Members may address issues during the open forum portion of the meeting. If attendees become disruptive, they may be expelled from the meeting and/or fined.&quot;&nbsp;[Rules of conduct should be added to each&nbsp; meeting agenda &nbsp;so attendees know what they can and cannot do.] &nbsp; Eject them from the meeting (avoid physical contact, or they may claim assault and battery) and call the police if they refuse to leave; &nbsp; Move the meeting to a member&#39;s unit (if disruptive owners force their way into the unit, it would be trespassing); &nbsp; Obtain a&nbsp; restraining order ; &nbsp; Broadcast meetings to the membership. Non-Members . &nbsp;Disruptive non-members may be excluded from meetings altogether.
